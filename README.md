- The Data is from an auction experiment hold in class, Topics in Experimental Economics, in NTU.
- To discuss what were the important factors that affected the strategies used by buyers and sellers.
-	Used linear regression, which contains independent variables such as values of goods, previous profits, and whether buyers accepted prices in the previous period.
-	Found that when the deal succeeded in the previous period, buyers tended to lower their willingness to pay; prices that sellers offered and the values of goods have a positive correlation.
